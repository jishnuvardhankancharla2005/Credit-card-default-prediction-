# Credit Card Default Prediction (UCI) — ML + Flask Web App

A machine learning project that predicts whether a credit card client is likely to default on the next month’s payment using the UCI Credit Card Default dataset. The project includes model training in a Jupyter Notebook and a Flask web application for interactive predictions. 

---

## Project Overview

This project builds a binary classification model to predict `default.payment.next.month` from client demographic features, repayment status history, bill statements, and past payment amounts. 
A Flask UI collects user inputs (e.g., LIMIT_BAL, SEX, EDUCATION, MARRIAGE, PAY status, BILL_AMT, PAY_AMT) and returns a prediction using a serialized ML model (`model.pkl`). 

---

## Tech Stack

- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) for preprocessing and modeling.   
- Jupyter Notebook for EDA, training, evaluation, and model export via `pickle`.   
- Flask for building a simple prediction web app that loads `model.pkl` and predicts using a DataFrame built from form inputs.

---

## Model Details

- Train/test split is used and features are scaled using `StandardScaler`.  
- A Logistic Regression classifier is trained and evaluated, then exported as `model.pkl`. 
- Notebook reports an accuracy around `0.8098` on the test set (based on the stored notebook output).

## Repository Structure

├── UCI_Credit_Card.csv # Dataset​
├── main.ipynb # EDA + training + evaluation + model export​
├── app.py # Flask app for inference​
├── model.pkl # Saved model (generated by notebook)​
└── templates/
└── index.html # Flask UI template (required by app.py)


> Note: `app.py` uses `render_template("index.html")`, so a `templates/index.html` file must exist for the app to run.

## How to Run (Local)

### 1) Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv

Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

### 2) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don’t have a `requirements.txt` yet, create one (suggested baseline):
Flask
pandas
scikit-learn
numpy
(Adjust based on your environment.) 

### 3) Train and export the model
Run the notebook `main.ipynb` to generate `model.pkl` using `pickle.dump(...)`. 

### 4) Start the Flask app
python app.py

Then open:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
The app runs with `debug=True` in the current script.

## How the Web App Works

- The form values are mapped to numeric codes for categorical inputs like EDUCATION and MARRIAGE. 
- Inputs are assembled into a pandas DataFrame with columns matching the model features (e.g., `LIMIT_BAL`, `PAY_0`, `BILL_AMT1`, `PAY_AMT6`, etc.). 
- The loaded `model.pkl` predicts class `0/1` and returns a user-friendly message for default risk. 

---

## Results & Notes

- The notebook includes EDA plots and feature importance inspection using `abs(model.coef_)` for Logistic Regression. 
- Consider adding additional metrics (ROC-AUC, confusion matrix), cross-validation, and class imbalance handling to improve default-class recall. 

---

## Future Improvements

- Add model versioning and reproducible pipelines (e.g., `Pipeline` with scaler + model). 
- Improve UI/UX and add input validation (range checks, required fields). 
- Containerize using Docker and deploy to a cloud platform (Render/Railway/Heroku alternatives).

## Dataset

This project uses the UCI Credit Card Default dataset (commonly known as “Default of Credit Card Clients”).
